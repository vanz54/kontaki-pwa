# Kontaki

Kontaki is my first project of a progressive web application in Angular. Is my first approach to web developement which started with a course at my university.

The idea of making this application was born because to keep track of income and expenses in my bank account I have always used an Excel spreadsheet, so I decided to upgrade and facilitate this monitoring by combining the possibility of studying for an interesting exam and the actual use of the app I would have made.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project and `npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1 dist/kontaki ` to use it, this will start up an http-server, serving the build artifacts stored in the `dist/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server, with new versions of Angular a dev server can also use the service worker and after a initial spam-reload situation then the application can be tested. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` where the application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
